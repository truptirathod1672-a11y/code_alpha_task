This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.
It uses Machine Learning to classify Iris flowers into different species
based on their physical measurements.

Project Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts the species of an Iris flower
(Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) using flower measurements.

Dataset
- Iris Dataset (CSV format)
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target:
  - Species

 Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression


 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

 Project Workflow
1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Clean the data
3. Split features and target
4. Train-test split
5. Train Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluate model accuracy
7. Predict flower species
8. Save trained model

 Results
- High accuracy achieved on test data
- Model successfully predicts Iris species
